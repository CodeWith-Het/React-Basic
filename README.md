This only study purpose. How to Work two way blinding in react

-->wo-way binding" means that your UI and your component’s state stay in sync — when the user changes the UI (like typing in an input), it updates the state, and when the state changes, it updates the UI.

React doesn’t have automatic two-way binding like Angular, but we can simulate it using:
-->State → to store the data.
-->onChange handler → to update state when the user changes the input.
-->value attribute → to set the input value from state.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
## Fixing the Typo

There is a typo in the description above:  
`wo-way binding` should be `two-way binding`.

**Corrected sentence:**

> "Two-way binding" means that your UI and your component’s state stay in sync — when the user changes the UI (like typing in an input), it updates the state, and when the state changes, it updates the UI.
