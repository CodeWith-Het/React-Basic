This only study purpose. How to Work two way blinding in react

-->wo-way binding" means that your UI and your component’s state stay in sync — when the user changes the UI (like typing in an input), it updates the state, and when the state changes, it updates the UI.

React doesn’t have automatic two-way binding like Angular, but we can simulate it using:
-->State → to store the data.
-->onChange handler → to update state when the user changes the input.
-->value attribute → to set the input value from state.
